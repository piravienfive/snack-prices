# 🍪 Sri Lankan Snacks Order Calculator

## 📖 Background
My mum has been making traditional Sri Lankan snacks for customers her whole life. She knows the recipes by heart, but keeping track of prices and quickly adding up totals has become harder over time.

I built this project as a small, fun way to help her. It’s a simple web page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) where you can pick snacks from a dropdown, add them to an order list, enter quantities, and calculate the total in **£**.

For now, it’s just for family use, but in the future it could grow into a small tool that her customers can use directly to build their own orders online.
